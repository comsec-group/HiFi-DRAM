# HiFi-DRAM: Enabling High-fidelity DRAM Research by Uncovering Sense Amplifiers with IC Imaging
## Supplementary material

This repository provides supplementary material for our paper _[HiFi-DRAM: Enabling High-fidelity DRAM Research by Uncovering Sense Amplifiers with IC Imaging](https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/hifi-dram/)_ that is to appear in the 51st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA 2024).

We provide:
1. the full images of the layers extracted from the DRAM chips  (./Layer images)
2. the layout schematics extracted (./Layouts)
3. the measured transistor dimensions for the sense amplifiers elements (./Measures.md)
